** This is my emacs configuration

There are many like it, but this one is mine.

** Quick Setup

The only required MELPA plugin is the [[https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package]][use-package]]. If it doesn't install automatically, run:

```
package-install RET use-package RET
```

** Hand me my/packs

When I use use-package, I almost always want to (a.) install the package and then (b.) configure the package in its config-package.el file. As such, you can install a new MELPA package using:

```
my/packs/inst RET package-name RET
```

This will install the package and also autogenerate a configuration file, which you can edit at:

```
my/packs/conf RET package-name RET
```

Packages can be activated/deactivated manually:

```
my/packs/load RET package-name RET
```

Or you can add the package to init.el:

```lisp
(my/packs/load
 ;; core packs
 'melpa
 'backups
 'package-name
 ...
 'split
 'hours)
```
